# Android-rfcomm

A simple skeleton app which connects to a robot via rfcomm, gets some status
information and exchanges binary values.

The app was developed using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
and the test device was an old Nexus 4. Practically speaking any Android device
with Bluetooth support should work.

The app is by no means complete and takes some shortcuts. It's supposed to get
you started in building your very personal app to control your very own robot.
